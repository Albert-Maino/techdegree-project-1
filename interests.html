        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I have many interests that keep me busy such as:</p>
        <br>
          <h3><strong>Video Games</strong></h3>
            <p>I have been playing video games since I was a kid. I'm experienced on all systems dating back to Nintendo 64, GameCube, Xbox, and more. Video games are my biggest hobby but it has taught me team work and communication skills. I enjoy playing all games but mainly shooting and survival games!</p>
          <h3><strong>Computer Repair and Assembly</strong></h3>
            <p>I started building computers a few years ago and I have loved it since then. I've learned about many different computer specifications and troubleshooting skills. When my family and friends have a computer problem I'm the one they call!</p>
          <h3><strong>Basketball</strong></h3>
            <p>My family has been a basketball family since before I was born. This sport has taught me many life skills such as mental toughness, problem solving, and resilience. A quote from the best basketball player of all time has always motivated me to never give up.</p>
            <q>I've failed over and over and over again in my life... That is why I <strong>succeed.</strong></q><cite>- Michael Jordan</cite>
